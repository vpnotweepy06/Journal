Willow is a simple Journal Web Application built using Flask as a practice project to learn the fundamentals of web development with Python. The app allows users to register, log in, create, edit, and delete journal entries with support for tagging and filtering. It uses Flask-SQLAlchemy for database management, WTForms for form handling, and Bootstrap for styling. To make the project more professional and organized, the repository also includes a requirements.txt file for dependency management, a .gitignore file to keep unnecessary files out of version control, and a well-structured README with setup instructions, usage details, and future improvements. The commit history follows clear and descriptive messages (e.g., “Add entry model”, “Fix navbar alignment”), making the development process easy to follow. Even though this was created as a practice project, the structure is designed to resemble a real-world Flask project, making it useful as a portfolio showcase while learning Git, Flask, and deployment basics.

Some potential enhancements that could be added in the future include:

1.Dark Mode / Theme Customization for a more personalized experience.

2.Search & Filter functionality to quickly find past entries by keywords or tags.

3.Mobile Responsiveness for better usability on smartphones and tablets.

4.Reminders & Notifications to encourage consistent journaling.

5.Export / Backup Options (PDF, CSV, or cloud sync).

6.User Profiles & Settings for a more personalized journaling space.
