Journal App is a lightweight personal journaling application built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Bootstrap. It allows users to register, log in, and manage their journal entries with ease. Each entry can have a title, detailed content, and optional tags for better organization. Once logged in, users can add new entries, edit existing ones, or delete them if no longer needed. All data is stored in a secure SQLite database, making the app simple yet powerful enough for everyday journaling.

To get started, clone the repository and make sure you have Python installed. Create a virtual environment, install the required dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt, and then run the application using python app.py. By default, the app will be available locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. If you want to open it on your phone while connected to the same WiFi, you can run it with python app.py --host=0.0.0.0 and then visit http://<your-computer-ip>:5000/ on your mobile browser.

This project is designed to be a personal productivity tool, but it can also serve as a great starting point for learning Flask. You can extend it by adding features like password resets, profile customization, search and filtering of entries, exporting journal data to PDF, or even packaging it into an Android APK with frameworks like BeeWare or Kivy. With its clean interface and simple structure, Journal App provides both practicality and flexibility for personal use or future development.
